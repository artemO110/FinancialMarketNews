Background
Financial market analysts add their posts to a database hosted in Firebase. In the initial version of the website you are developing, the Index page displays the list of all titles from the Firebase database. When the user clicks on a title, the Detail page displays all the data from the Firebase database for the selected post/article.

You do not have to understand the job of the financial market analysts or the content of the information they gather and put into the Firebase database.
You should be familiar with the Javascript language and the React framework.
You may have to look up details about how to perform functions and write code with which you are not already familiar. Every project involves some aspect of discovery and learning new techniques.
When you have completed your Deliverable for this project, feel free to add a link to your coding in your CV. It will be a great addition to your portfolio. Be aware, however, that potential future employers will review your code, so do not write anything in the code that would embarrass you or offend others.
